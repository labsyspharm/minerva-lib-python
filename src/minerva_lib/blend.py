    By default, a new output array will be allocated to hold
    the result of the composition operation. To update _target_
    in place instead, specify the same array for _target_ and _out_.

    Args:
        target: Numpy array containing composition target image
        image: Numpy array of image to render and composite
        color: Color as r, g, b float array within 0, 1
        range_min: Threshhold range minimum, float within 0, 1
        range_max: Threshhold range maximum, float within 0, 1
        out: Optional output numpy array in which to place the result.

    Returns:
        A numpy array with the same shape as the composited image.
        If an output array is specified, a reference to _out_ is returned.
